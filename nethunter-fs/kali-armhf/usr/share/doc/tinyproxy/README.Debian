tinyproxy for Debian
----------------------

This is a Debianized version of Tinyproxy, a lightweight, non-caching,
optionally anonymizing HTTP proxy.

Note: While older versions of tinyproxy relied on commanline arguments
for its parameters, recent versions of tinyproxy maintain a configuration
file in /etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf, where anonymization, ports, etc.,
are specified.
