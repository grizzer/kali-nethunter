 This program is free software; you may redistribute and/or modify it under
 the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
 Software Foundation; Version 2 (or later) with the clarifications and
 exceptions described below. This guarantees your right to use, modify, and
 redistribute this software under certain conditions. If you wish to embed
 sqlmap technology into proprietary software, we sell alternative licenses
 (contact sales@sqlmap.org).
 .
 Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derived works", yet it
 does not provide a detailed definition of that term. To avoid
 misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law
 allows. For example, we consider an application to constitute a "derived
 work" for the purpose of this license if it does any of the following:
 * Integrates source code from sqlmap.
 * Reads or includes sqlmap copyrighted data files, such as xml/queries.xml
 * Executes sqlmap and parses the results (as opposed to typical shell or
   execution-menu apps, which simply display raw sqlmap output and so are
   not derivative works).
 * Integrates/includes/aggregates sqlmap into a proprietary executable
   installer, such as those produced by InstallShield.
 * Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above
 .
 The term "sqlmap" should be taken to also include any portions or derived
 works of sqlmap. This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our
 interpretation of derived works with some common examples. Our
 interpretation applies only to sqlmap - we do not speak for other people's
 GPL works.
 .
 If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using
 sqlmap in non-GPL works, we would be happy to help. As mentioned above,
 we also offer alternative license to integrate sqlmap into proprietary
 applications and appliances.
 If you received these files with a written license agreement or contract
 stating terms other than the terms above, then that alternative license
 agreement takes precedence over these comments.
 .
 Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a right
 to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it.
 .
 Source code also allows you to fix bugs and add new features. You are
 highly encouraged to send your changes to dev@sqlmap.org for possible
 incorporation into the main distribution. By sending these changes to the
 sqlmap developers, to the mailing lists, or via Git pull request, checking
 them into the sqlmap source code repository, it is understood (unless you
 specify otherwise) that you are offering the sqlmap project the unlimited,
 non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense the code. sqlmap will
 always be available Open Source, but this is important because the
 inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free
 Software projects (such as KDE and NASM). If you wish to specify special
 license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you send them.
