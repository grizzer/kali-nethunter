	Some file systems, such as ext2 can report incorrect block sizes
when examining files via stat (); for example, on a 1024-byte ext2 file
system, the file system block size is reported as being 4096. This can
cause minor problems (short writes) when wiping a file whose size is
not a multiple of the reported block size on a file system having no
more free blocks, since wipe will by default round up the size to the
next multiple of the reported block size in order to erase possible
data remaining beyond the end of the file (this can happen if the file
shrinked, for example). I can't think of any non-invasive method for
getting the real block size. Since this is a very small problem, I think
that it is not worth adding an option for specifying the real block size.
