pyrit for Debian
----------------

Pyrit consists of a standalone application and optional extensions for various
GPGPU-technologies.

This package provides the full-featured application, which will run on any
system. It has built-in support for MMX, SSE2 and VIA PADLOCK; these are
detected at runtime.

python-scapy and python-sqlalchemy (as well as a back-end, e.g. python-sqlite)
aren't strictly required, but you really want them if you're only going to use
Pyrit on a single node.

The optional extensions might be available as packages in the contrib section.
These should be named "pyrit-*". The availability of these packages depends
on whether they were released in time for the current Debian release, and
whether your architecture is supported by these packages. If your system does
not have these packages, you can alternatively get the source directly from
upstream's homepage instead.
