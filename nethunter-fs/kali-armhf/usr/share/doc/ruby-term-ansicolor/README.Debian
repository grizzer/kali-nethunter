term-ansicolor for Debian
-------------------------

The original term-ansicolor package provides a command called `cdiff` that
colorizes diff output. The package colordiff also provides a command called
`cdiff` that does the same thing, so the term-ansicolor Debian package does not
install `cdiff`. If you need that functionality, please install and use the
colordiff package.
