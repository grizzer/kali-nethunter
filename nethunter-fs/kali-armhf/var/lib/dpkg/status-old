 executed. Think of it as a more flexible version of the #! executable
 interpreter mechanism.
 .
 This package provides an 'update-binfmts' script with which package
 maintainers can register interpreters to be used with this module without
 having to worry about writing their own init.d scripts, and which sysadmins
 can use for a slightly higher-level interface to this module.

Description: Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
 cards.  It mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
 operations. It facilitates their use in security applications such as
 mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
 implements the PKCS#11 API. Applications supporting this API, such as
 Iceweasel and Icedove, can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15
 standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
 well.
 .
 Before purchasing any cards, please read carefully documentation in
 /usr/share/doc/opensc/html/wiki/index.html - only some cards are
 supported. Not only does card type matters, but also card version,
 card OS version and preloaded applet. Only a subset of possible
 operations may be supported for your card. Card initialization may
 require third party proprietary software.
 .
 This package contains tools for intearacting with smart cards.

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.
 .

Description: API library for scanners -- extra backends
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes some backends that are not yet included into the
 official SANE distribution. Currently, they are :
   * geniusvp2 (Genius ColorPage-Vivid Pro II)
   * ls5000 (Nikon LS-5000 ED, Coolscan 5000 ED)

Description: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description: Modular Ruby webserver interface
 Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for
 developing web applications in Ruby.  By wrapping HTTP requests and
 responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the
 API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the
 so-called middleware) into a single method call.
 .
 The exact details of this are described in the Rack specification,
 which all Rack applications should conform to.

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from

 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.

Description: Layout and rendering of internationalized text
 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .
 This is a transitional package.

Description: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Perl DBI driver with a self-contained RDBMS
 DBD::SQLite is a Perl DBI driver with a self-contained relational database
 management system. It embeds a small and fast embedded SQL database engine
 called SQLite (see sqlite3) into a DBI driver. It is useful if you want a
 relational database for your project, but don't want to install a large
 RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
 .
 SQLite supports the following features:
 .
  * Implements a large subset of SQL92 (<URL:http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html>)
  * A complete DB in a single disk file
    Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
    easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
  * Atomic commit and rollback
 .
 The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does perform a global
 lock on the entire database. This, obviously, might not be good for multiple
 user systems. The database also appears to be significantly faster if your
 transactions are coarse.

 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

Description: active password cracking tool
 John the Ripper is a tool designed to help systems administrators to
 find weak (easy to guess or crack through brute force) passwords, and
 even automatically mail users warning them about it, if it is desired.
 .
 Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly found on
 various Unix flavors, supported out of the box are Kerberos AFS and
 Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hashes, plus several more with contributed
 patches.

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 (SSL) functions of the SSLeay library directly from your perl scripts. It
 is useful if you want to program robots that access secure web servers or
 if you want to build your own applications over SSL encrypted tunnels. If
 you just want to view web pages on https servers, you do not need this -
 your web browser already knows to do that.

Description: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

 UDP, TCP, SSL). It provides forking, logging and tracing, different
 modes for interprocess communication and many more options.
 .
 It can be used, for example, as a TCP relay (one-shot or daemon),
 as an external socksifier, as a shell interface to Unix sockets,
 as an IPv6 relay, as a netcat and rinetd replacement, to redirect
 TCP-oriented programs to a serial line, or to establish a relatively
 secure environment (su and chroot) for running client or server shell
 scripts inside network connections. Socat supports sctp as of 1.7.0.

 Python, there are  several reasons why you might want  to take a look
 at PLY:
  * It's implemented entirely in Python.
  * It uses  LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient  and well suited
    for larger grammars.
  * PLY  provides most  of  the standard  lex/yacc features  including
    support for  empty productions, precedence  rules, error recovery,
    and support for ambiguous grammars.
  * PLY is  extremely easy  to use and  provides very  extensive error

 vulnerabilities in web applications. Once it detects one or more SQL
 injections on the target host, the user can choose among a variety of
 options to perform an extensive back-end database management system
 fingerprint, retrieve DBMS session user and database, enumerate users,
 password hashes, privileges, databases, dump entire or user's specific
 DBMS tables/columns, run his own SQL statement, read specific files on
 the file system and more.

 Concurrently open either Shodan search results, a specified IP, IP range, or
 domain and print the status and title of the page if applicable. Add the -u and
 -p options to attempt to login to the page first looking for a form login and
 failing that, attempt HTTP Basic Auth.
 .
 Use -f SEARCHSTRING to look for a certain string in the html response in order
 to test if authentication succeeded. Logs all devices that respond using either
 the Shodan search term or the target IPs/domain + _results.txt. One caveat with
 searching the response page's HTML is that some form login pages return a JSON
 object response after an authentication request rather than the post-login
 page's HTML source. Often you can determine whether or not you were successful
 by just using -f "success"
 .
 Default timeout on the requests is 12 seconds. Sends batches of 1000 requests
 concurrently which can be adjust using the -c option. One should note that
 Shodan only allows the first page of results (100 hosts) if you are using their
 free API key. If you have their professional API key you can specify the number
 of search result pages to test with the -n NUMBER_OF_PAGES argument. By default
 it will only check page 1.

 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time

Description: HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent
 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

 pefile is a Python module to read and work with Portable Executable (PE)
 files. Most of the information in the PE header is accessible, as well as all
 the sections, section information and data.
 .
 All the basic PE file structures are available with their default names as
 attributes of the returned instance.
 .
 Processed elements such as the import table are made available with lowercase
 names, to differentiate them from the upper case basic structure names.
 .
 pefile has been tested against the limits of valid PE headers; that is,
 Windows malware. Lots of packed malware attempt to abuse the format beyond its
 standard use.
 .
 Some of the tasks that pefile makes possible are:
  * Modifying and writing back to the PE image
  * Header inspection
  * Section analysis
  * Retrieving data
  * Warnings for suspicious and malformed values
  * Packer detection with PEiD signatures
  * PEiD signature generation

 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.

Description: X11 utilities
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X utilities
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - appres, editres, listres and viewres, which query the X resource database;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X;
  - xdriinfo, query configuration information of DRI drivers;
  - xev, an X event displayer;
  - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a given X font;
  - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts;
  - xkill, a tool for terminating misbehaving X clients;
  - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X server;
  - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display;
  - xlsfonts, a server font list displayer;
  - xmessage, a tool to display message or dialog boxes;
  - xprop, a property displayer for X;
  - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X;
  - xwininfo, a window information utility for X;
 .
 The editres and viewres programs use bitmap images provided by the
 xbitmaps package. The luit program requires locale information from
 the libx11-data package.

Description: Ruby/EventMachine library
 EventMachine implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network
 communications. It's extremely easy to use in Ruby. EventMachine wraps all
 interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate on the
 implementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both network
 servers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program only needs
 to specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that implements the
 communications protocol. Implementations of several standard network protocols
 are provided with the package, primarily to serve as examples. The real goal
 of EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs
 using TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Description: virtual network computing server software
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a server to which X clients can connect and the
 server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 The difference between the tightvncserver and the normal vncserver is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 vncserver (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.
 .
 Note: This server does not support or need a display. You need a vncviewer to
 see something. However, this viewer may also be on a computer running other
 operating systems in the local net.

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been
 split into separate packages.
 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support
 .
 This package contains the GNOME support shared library.

 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends

 More specifically, it contains the improvements to KARMA attacks
 implemented into hostapd, as well as some useful configs for conducting MitM
 once you've managed to get a victim to connect.
 .
 You'll need a wifi card that supports master mode. You can check whether it
 does by running “iw list”. You want to see “AP” in the output.

Description: Smart card utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
 cards.  It mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
 operations. It facilitates their use in security applications such as
 mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
 implements the PKCS#11 API. Applications supporting this API, such as
 Iceweasel and Icedove, can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15
 standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
 well.
 .
 Before purchasing any cards, please read carefully documentation in
 /usr/share/doc/opensc/html/wiki/index.html - only some cards are
 supported. Not only does card type matters, but also card version,
 card OS version and preloaded applet. Only a subset of possible
 operations may be supported for your card. Card initialization may
 require third party proprietary software.
 .
 This package contains the pkcs11 module.

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: runtime files for the OpenEXR image library
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 .
 This package contains the following shared library:

 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .

 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes documentation for libsane, such as the man pages
 and list of supported scanners, and support files (i18n data).

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .

    The libcroco parser implements the CSS Level 2 specification, the CSS
    forward compatibility rules and the CSS cascading rules.
 .
  * A CSS2 selection engine
    Given an xml element node (that obviously comes from an xml document) and
    a stylesheet cascade, the Libcroco selection engine can evaluate the css
    selectors of the cascade and return the style properties associated to
    the xml element node.
 .
    Note that the xml manipulation toolkit used by the libcroco selection
    engine at the moment is libxml2.

 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: 7z and 7za file archivers with high compression ratio
 p7zip is the Unix command-line port of 7-Zip, a file archiver that
 archives with high compression ratios.
 .
 p7zip-full provides utilities to pack and unpack 7z archives within
 a shell or using a GUI (such as Ark, File Roller or Nautilus).
 .
 Installing p7zip-full allows File Roller to use the very efficient 7z
 compression format for packing and unpacking files and directories.
 Additionally, it provides the 7z and 7za commands.
 .
 List of supported formats:
   - Packing / unpacking: 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2, XZ and TAR
   - Unpacking only: APM, ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT,
     HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, LZMA2, MBR, MSI, MSLZ, NSIS, NTFS, RAR (only
     if non-free p7zip-rar package is installed), RPM, SquashFS, UDF,
     VHD, WIM, XAR and Z.
 .
 p7zip provides 7zr, a light version of 7za, and p7zip, a gzip-like
 wrapper around 7zr.

Description: utility for manipulating the MAC address of network interfaces
 GNU MAC Changer is an utility that makes the maniputation of MAC addresses of
 network interfaces easier.  MAC addresses are unique identifiers on networks,
 they only need to be unique, they can be changed on most network hardware.
 MAC addresses have started to be abused by unscrupulous marketing firms,
 government agencies, and others to provide an easy way to track a computer
 across multiple networks.  By changing the MAC address regularly, this kind
 of tracking can be thwarted, or at least made a lot more difficult.
 .
 Features:
 .
   * set specific MAC address of a network interface
   * set the MAC randomly
   * set a MAC of another vendor
   * set another MAC of the same vendor
   * set a MAC of the same kind (eg: wireless card)
   * display a vendor MAC list (today, 6200 items) to choose from

Description: 75 dpi fonts for X
 xfonts-75dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per inch.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains only fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-75dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or
 small screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xfonts-utils package to prepare the font
 directories for use by an X server or X font server.

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors
 .
 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam
 Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel
 Shamir, which can be found at
 http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf

 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 There is now a bufferevent type that supports SSL/TLS using the
 OpenSSL library.  The code for this is build in a separate
 library, libevent_openssl, so that your programs don't need to
 link against OpenSSL unless they actually want SSL support.

 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.

 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
 purposes.

Description: Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)
 BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration
 testing tool that focuses on the web browser.
 .
 Amid growing concerns about web-born attacks against clients, including
 mobile clients, BeEF allows the professional penetration tester to assess the
 actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack
 vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened
 network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the
 context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web
 browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and
 further attacks against the system from within the browser context.

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

 (request, answer) and a list of unmatched packets. This has the big advantage
 over tools like nmap or hping that an answer is not reduced to
 (open/closed/filtered), but is the whole packet.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML
 syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako's
 syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django
 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
 straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
 ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

Description: object-relational SQL database (supported version)
 This metapackage always depends on the currently supported PostgreSQL
 database server version.
 .
 PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management
 system.  It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed
 to be extensible by users in many aspects.  Some of the features are:
 ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries,
 triggers, user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion
 concurrency control.  Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many
 programming languages are available as well.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library (core)
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 The libevent_core library includes event loops, timers, buffer code,
 and various small compatibility functions.
 .
 If you're writing software that only uses libevent's event loop, you
 should link against only the libevent_core library.

 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
 Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
 SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

 Objects of the HTML::Parser class will recognize markup and separate it from
 content data. As different kinds of markup are recognized, the corresponding
 event handler is invoked. The document to be parsed may also be supplied in
 arbitrary chunks, making on-the-fly parsing of network documents possible.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

 The cryptography library is designed to be a "one-stop-shop" for

 .
 As an alternative to the libraries that came before it, cryptography
 tries to address some of the issues with those libraries:
  - Lack of PyPy and Python 3 support.
  - Lack of maintenance.
  - Use of poor implementations of algorithms (i.e. ones with known
    side-channel attacks).
  - Lack of high level, "Cryptography for humans", APIs.
  - Absence of algorithms such as AES-GCM.
  - Poor introspectability, and thus poor testability.
  - Extremely error prone APIs, and bad defaults.

 This package contains the Python 2 version of cryptography.

 lxml aims to provide a Pythonic API by following as much as possible
 the ElementTree API, trying to avoid inventing too many new APIs,
 or the user's having to learn new things -- XML is complicated enough.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

 IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page
 images. This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the protocol,
 the design of which is still in flux. When the protocol specification is
 published, it will be authoritative. Applications should feel free to link
 against the library provided in this package, adapt that code for their own
 needs, or roll a completely new implementation.
 .
 IJS is a client-server protocol, used to write ghostscript drivers. The
 drivers are separate programs. The client and server communicate via pipes,
 though shared memory may be used additionally in the future. Currently IJS
 is used by the hpijs and ijsgimpprint drivers.
 .
 Code for both the client- and server-side is included in the library. This
 package provides the shared library.

 Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images

 by a media player.  Most audio visualization is tied to a specific
 application or media player, making it difficult to share code.
 Libvisual allows applications to use existing visualization plugins
 written for the libvisual framework.

 is not very useful without visualization plugins, so it is highly

Description: X Rendering Extension client library
 The X Rendering Extension (Render) introduces digital image composition as
 the foundation of a new rendering model within the X Window System.
 Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into
 either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the
 server and rendering sets of them.  The Xrender library exposes this
 extension to X clients.

Pre-Depends: libc6 (>= 2.17)

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: powerful and flexible message logging mechanism
 Log::Message is a generic message storage mechanism. It allows you to store
 messages on a stack -- either shared or private -- and assign meta-data to
 it. Some meta-data will automatically be added for you, like a timestamp and
 a stack trace, but some can be filled in by the user, like a tag by which to
 identify it or group it, and a level at which to handle the message (for
 example, log it, or die with it)
 .
 Log::Message also provides a powerful way of searching through items by
 regexes on messages, tags and level.

 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description: simple argparse wrapper
 Argh provides a very simple wrapper for argparse.
 .
 Argparse is a very powerful tool; argh just makes it easy to use.
 .
 Here’s a list of features that argh adds to argparse:
 .
  * mark a function as a CLI command and specify its arguments before
    the parser is instantiated;
  * nested commands made easy: no messing with subparsers;
  * infer command name from function name;
  * infer agrument type from the default value;
  * infer argument action from the default value (for booleans);
  * infer arguments from function signature;
  * add an alias root command help for the --help argument;
  * enable passing unwrapped arguments to certain functions instead of
    an argparse.Namespace object.
 .
 Argh is fully compatible with argparse. You can mix argh-agnostic and
 argh-aware code. Just keep in mind that dispatch() does some extra
 work that a custom dispatcher may not do.

Description: multiple precision complex floating-point library
 MPC is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision
 arithmetic on complex numbers providing correct rounding. For the time
 being, it contains all arithmetic operations over complex numbers, the
 exponential and the logarithm functions, the trigonometric and
 hyperbolic functions.

Description: boot sequence organizer using LSB init.d script dependency information
 The insserv program is used by the standard SysV-based init system. It
 updates the order of symlinks in /etc/rc?.d/ based on dependencies
 specified by LSB headers in the init.d scripts themselves.
 .
 These declared relations between scripts make it possible to optimize
 the boot sequence for the currently installed set of packages, while
 detecting and rejecting dependency loops.
 .
 Using insserv incorrectly can result in an unbootable system.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

 and offers many additional features characteristic of a more modern install
 system, including simple subclassing for custom build actions.
 .
 Because it is written in Pure Perl, it has very few external dependencies. In
 particular, it allows for installation of packages on systems without 'make'
 and will even work without a shell. Its only prerequisites are modules that
 are included with perl 5.6.0 and it is core as of perl 5.10.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

 advanced features of the Synaptics Touchpad including:
 .
  * Movement with adjustable, non-linear acceleration and speed
  * Button events through short touching of the touchpad
  * Double-Button events through double short touching of the touchpad
  * Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad
  * Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad
  * Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger
    on the right side of the touchpad
  * The up/down button sends button four/five events
  * Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events) through moving the finger
    on the lower side of the touchpad
  * The multi-buttons send button four/five events, and six/seven events for
    horizontal scrolling
  * Adjustable finger detection
  * Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button and three finger for right
    button events. (Needs hardware support. Not all models implement this
    feature.)
  * Run-time configuration using shared memory. This means you can change
    parameter settings without restarting the X server (see synclient(1)).
  * It also provides a daemon to disable touchpad while typing at the keyboard
    and thus avoid unwanted mouse movements (see syndaemon(1)).

Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters (extra variants)
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .
 This package includes additional variants, such as oblique, italic,
 bold-oblique, bold-italic and the condensed forms.
 .
 DejaVu fonts are intended for use on low-resolution devices (mainly
 computer screens) but can be used in printing as well.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: bash tab completion for argparse
 Argcomplete provides easy, extensible command line tab completion of
 arguments for your Python script.
 .
 It makes two assumptions:
 .
  * You're using bash as your shell
  * You're using argparse to manage your command line arguments/options
 .
 Argcomplete is particularly useful if your program has lots of
 options or subparsers, and if your program can dynamically suggest
 completions for your argument/option values (for example, if the user
 is browsing resources over the network).
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 2.x.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

 LPeg is a new pattern-matching library for Lua, based on Parsing Expression
 Grammars (PEGs). PEGs look similar to regular expressions or context-free

 regular expressions, because they are strictly more powerful. For example, a
 regular expression inherently cannot find matched pairs of parentheses, because
 it is not recursive, but a PEG can.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

 new proposed features of 2.0, including:
  * Batch submission (via MultiCall)
  * Keyword arguments
  * Notifications (both in a batch and 'normal')
  * Class translation using the 'jsonclass' key.

Description: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.
